    "content": "# Calendar and Events The TIMU calendar displays all events you have been invited to or have accepted an invitation to (but not events that are canceled, or events for which you have declined the invitation) in a convenient month-by-month layout. Week and day views are also available. To change the view type, click the “Change” button and select a different view type. ![Calendar screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) To advance forward or backward in months/weeks/days, click the arrow buttons to the left and right of the month (or week/day if using a different view type) label. To create a new private event, click the “New Private Event” button. You can also create a new private event on a specific day by double-clicking in the blank space within that day’s cell on the calendar. (Similarly, on the week and day views you can create new events at a specific time by double-clicking on a blank spot in the timeline.) SEE: [Event Creation](Event%20Creation.html) To access an existing event, click on the event’s name on the calendar. A pop-up will appear with various options related to the event. If you are an event owner, you can edit or cancel the event from this pop-up. To view the event’s details, click the “Details” button. To join the event’s video call, click the “Join” button. You will be taken to the video call lobby. SEE: [Event Details](Event%20Details.html), [Video Calls](Video%20Calls.html) ![Event popup card screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) On the calendar month view, if there are more than five events on a given day, you can view any additional events by clicking the “More” at the bottom of the calendar cell.

    "content": "# Event Creation Before creating a TIMU event, decide whether the event should be a private event, or a Workspace event. Private events are created through the TIMU calendar app, are not associated with a specific Workspace, and anyone in your network can be added to a private event. Workspace events are created from with a Workspace’s Events module, and everyone in that Workspace has access to the event. To create an event, click “New Private Event” from the TIMU calendar app, or click “New Workspace Event” from the Workspace Events module. ![Event creation step 1 screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) You will be prompted to specify a name for the event, a list of attendees to send invitations to (if the event is a private event), a start and end time and date, a time zone, and to choose whether the event will recur. To make a recurring event, from the dropdown labeled “Never Repeat”, choose the desired frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). On the recurrence details popup, specify when the event will recur and when the event series will terminate (if at all). You can also specify an event location and description. A default description is provided, and can be amended or replaced as necessary. Finally, choose whether the event will be in-person only, a video call, or a recorded video call. If the event is in-person only, attendees will not be able to join a video call for the event. If the event is set to recorded video call, the event will be recorded and transcribed. If you are creating a private event, click “Create” once you have filled out the event’s details. The event will be created and invitations sent to all attendees. You will be taken automatically to the event’s details screen. If you are creating a Workspace event, click “Next” once you have filled out the event’s details. You will be prompted to choose which Workspace members should be invited to the event. When you have selected the attendees, click “Create”. The event will be created and invitations sent to all attendees. You will be taken automatically to the event’s details screen. ![Workspace event invitation dialog screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) ",

    "content": "# Event Details The event details screen contains all information about an event or event series. ![Event details screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) Events in TIMU are either private events or Workspace events. Private events are created through the TIMU calendar app, are not associated with a specific Workspace, and anyone in your network can be added to a private event. Workspace events are created from with a Workspace’s Events module, and everyone in that Workspace has access to the event. From the event details screen, you can view the event’s time, location, description, and attendees, as well as your attendance status. To change your attendance status for the event, click the “Change RSVP” button and select a new status. If you are an owner of the event, click the “Edit Event” button to make changes to the event. If the event is an online meeting, you can click the “Join Meeting” button to launch the video call lobby screen. SEE: [Video Calls](Video%20Calls.html) On the right-hand side of the event details, you’ll be able to see the event calendar, the time and date of the selected event occurrence, your attendance status, and the list of attendees. If you are an event owner, invitations can be re-sent to all attendees by clicking the “Resend Invites” button. If you are viewing an event series, you will be able to see all occurrences within the series on the event calendar. Occurrences will be labeled with colored dots on the calendar. Click on a date to view the details of the occurrence taking place on that day. You can switch to the event’s comments or the Workspace file library using the tabs labeled “Comments” and “Files” at the top of the event details screen. ## Chat The event chat screen works in much the same way that chats and comments work throughout TIMU. The chat history is preserved, and you can scroll through it to review the conversation. You can react to individual messages by clicking the thumbs-up emoji icon, and selecting a reaction from the pop-up that appears. If you want to delete one of your own messages, click the triple-dot icon that appears when you hover over a message and select “Delete”. ![Event chat screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) To send a message, type your message in the reply box at the bottom of the feed and press Enter or click the “Send” button. As with all chat features in TIMU, you can attach files, share external links, and mention other users in the event with the @mention feature. Note that while @mentioning is supported in the event details, all users in the event will receive notifications for every message, regardless of whether they were mentioned in the message. If any users are currently viewing this event, their profile pictures will appear to the left of the “Send” button. ## File Library Whenever a user attaches a file to an event message, that file is automatically added to the Workspace’s file library. These files can be previewed, downloaded, and, in some cases, edited directly from the file library. Hovering over a file will cause the triple-dot icon to appear, and clicking on this icon allows you to rename, delete, or share the file. ![Event chat file library](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) Files in libraries support some bulk actions. To take a bulk action on a group of files (e.g., to delete more than one file at a time), click the checkbox to the left of the file name for each file you would like to select, then perform the action you want to take on the files as normal. File libraries support organization into folders and sub-folders. To create a new folder, click the “New Folder” button and specify a name for the folder. You can navigate between folder levels using the folder breadcrumbs that appears whenever you are viewing a folder’s contents. To add files directly to a file library, click the “Upload Files” button and select the files you want to attach from your computer. To create a brand new file (e.g., a new Microsoft Word document), click the “New File” button and select the type of file you would like to create. You will be asked to provide a name for the file. When the file is created, you will be immediately taken to the preview page for that file. To view a file’s preview, or to edit files (for file types supporting online editing), click the file’s name. SEE: [File Preview](File%20Preview.html) ",

Select “Start a New Team”. Select whether you would like your new Team to be private or public. Private Teams are visible only to their members, and users in your network must be invited to join a private Team. Public Teams are visible to everyone in your network, and can be joined through the “Join or Create Teams” page. If you don’t know what to choose, we recommend creating a private Team. You can always make your Team public later if you want to open it up to everyone in your network. ![Team privacy screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) You will then be prompted for a Team name. Your Team name must be unique within your network. You might also want to add a Team photo, which will appear alongside your Team’s name elsewhere in your TIMU network, and will help users quickly identify your Team. To add a Team photo, click the camera icon or the “Add a Photo” button. When you’ve finished, click “Create” to finalize your Team.

    "content": "# Teams and Workspaces TIMU networks are organized into Teams, and further broken down into Workspaces. ## Teams A TIMU Team is a collection of people who work together on something. A Team can represent a department, a large project, a club, a committee, or even your entire organization. It’s up to you and your organization how you want to set up your Teams. To create a new Team, click the “Join or Create Teams” button at the bottom of the Teams list. See: [Team Creation](Team%20Creation.html) Teams can be private or public. A private Team is visible only to its members, and in order for someone to join a private Team they need to be invited, or sent a special link. Public Teams are open to anyone in your organization, and they can be found by clicking “Join or Create Teams” from the Teams list. When your network is first created, a default Team (called “My Team”) is created. This special Team automatically includes all members of your network. You can use it for organization-wide discussion or announcements, or as a place to greet people new to your TIMU network. To manage a Team’s membership, permissions, or to create a new Workspace within the Team, click the triple-dot icon next to the Team’s name in the Teams list, and select the desired option from the context menu that appears. Note that many of these options are available only to Team owners. SEE: [Team Membership](Team%20Membership.html), [Workspace Creation](Workspace%20Creation.html) ## Workspaces A TIMU Workspace is where your Teams collaborate, share files, plan, and get work done. Each Team can have multiple Workspaces. Workspaces can be private or Team-wide. A private Workspace is a lot like a private Team - only people who belong to that Workspace can see it, and you need to be invited to join. Team-wide Workspaces include all members of the Team, so you never have to manage membership for a Team-wide Workspace. When a Team is created, a default Team-wide Workspace called “General” will also be created. To manage a Workspace’s permissions, rename, or delete a Workspace, hover over the Workspace’s name in the Teams list and click the triple-dot icon that appears. Note that some of these options are available only to users with ownership permissions over the Workspace. SEE: [Workspace Permissions](Workspace%20Permissions.html) Each TIMU Workspace has four modules: Posts, Files, Plans, and Events. To switch between modules, click the module tabs at the top of the Workspace. ## Posts The Posts module is a place for members of your Workspace to chat, post updates, get feedback, and stay up-to-date on what’s happening within the Workspace. Similar to a chat channel, you can type comments and replies, attach files, react to individual messages with emoji, and tag other Workspace members using the @mention feature. If you want to make sure that someone sees your post, @mention them. The user you mention will receive a notification about your post that they can follow directly into the chat. SEE: [Chat](Chat.html) ![Posts module screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) In addition to comments posted directly to the Posts module, this feed also displays comments made in other modules within the Workspace, including comments associated with files, events, and cards. These comments appear with a different background color, and indicate the file, event, or card they belong to. You can click on the name of the parent record to go directly to its details. ## Files Each Workspace has its own file library accessible only to members of that Workspace. All files attached anywhere in the Workspace appear here - including post attachments, attachments to event comments, and attachments to task comments. ![Files module screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) These files can be previewed, downloaded, and, in some cases, edited directly from the file library. Hovering over a file will cause the triple-dot icon to appear, and clicking on this icon allows you to rename, delete, or share the file. Files in libraries support some bulk actions. To take a bulk action on a group of files (e.g., to delete more than one file at a time), click the checkbox to the left of the file name for each file you would like to select, then perform the action you want to take on the files as normal. File libraries support organization into folders and sub-folders. To create a new folder, click the “New Folder” button and specify a name for the folder. You can navigate between folder levels using the folder breadcrumbs that appears whenever you are viewing a folder’s contents. If members of your workspace use the video call feature, you may see folders for event recordings and transcripts. To add files directly to a file library, click the “Upload Files” button and select the files you want to attach from your computer. To create a brand new file (e.g., a new Microsoft Word document), click the “New File” button and select the type of file you would like to create. You will be asked to provide a name for the file. When the file is created, you will be immediately taken to the preview page for that file. To view a file’s preview, or to edit files (for file types supporting online editing), click the file’s name. SEE: [File Preview](File%20Preview.html) Note that files uploaded to a Workspace’s file library count against the network’s overall storage limits. ## Plans SEE: [Plans](Tasks.html) ## Events Events that pertain to the work being done in a Workspace can be created from within the Workspace itself. To create a new Workspace event, click the Events tab at the top of the Workspace, then click the “New Event” button. SEE: [Event Creation](Event%20Creation.html) ![Workspace events module screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) The Events tab lists all events within the Workspace which are either currently ongoing, or are scheduled for the future. By default, canceled and past events are hidden from view. To see past of canceled events, click the checkbox labeled “Display past or canceled events only”. If you are an owner of the Workspace, you will be able to edit or cancel events from this page. All users can view the details of an event, or click the “Join” button to go directly to the lobby for the event’s video call. SEE: [Video Calls](Video%20Calls.html) Note that each event only appears once in the list of events, even if it is a recurring event. To view or modify a specific occurrence of an event series, open the event’s details and select the occurrence you want using the calendar in the upper right.

Each member of the Workspace is listed along with their permissions level. To change permissions, select a new permissions level from the drop-down menu and click “Save”. To remove members from the Workspace, click their remove icon, then click “Save”. It is not possible to remove yourself from the Workspace, or to modify your own permissions level. ![Private workspace permissions management screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) To add new members to the Workspace, click “Add From Team”.

To do so, click “Make It Public”. ## Team-wide Workspaces Team-wide Workspaces inherit their permission levels from the Team they belong to. Team owners have administrator permissions within the Workspace, and Team members have contributor permissions within the Workspace. To modify the membership of a Team-wide Workspace, you must modify the membership of the Team it belongs to. You can click “Team Membership” to go directly to the Team Membership dialog. SEE: [Team Membership](Team%20Membership.html) ![Team-wide workspaces permissions screenshot](https://fakeimg.pl/640x360/) You also have the option of converting the Team-wide Workspace to a private Workspace.
