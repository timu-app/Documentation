# Task Creation

To create a new task in a Tasks module, click the “New Task” button at the top of the screen.

You will be prompted to provide the task’s details. All tasks must have a name, and other fields may be required depending on the configuration of your Tasks module’s fields. SEE: [Edit Fields](Edit%20Fields.html)

If the Assigned To field is enabled and given a value, that user will receive a notification when the task is created letting them know that they have been assigned to a new task.

If the Description field is enabled and given a value, the contents of that field will be posted as the first comment in the task when it is created.
