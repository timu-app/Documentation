## Updates / History

The updates and history panel shows your recent notifications and the history of recent places you've been in your TIMU network, depending on which tab is selected.

In the updates tab, you'll see the same notifications that appear in the bell dropdown on the TIMU shell bar. Clicking on a notification will take you to the relevant location in your TIMU network. To view additional notifications, click "Show More".

Under the history tab, you will find the resources in your TIMU network you have visited most recently, allowing you to quickly return to what you were working on last. Click “Show More” to view a longer list of your recent TIMU history.
