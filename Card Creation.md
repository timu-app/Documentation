# Card Creation

To create a new card in a Plan module, click the '+' button at the top of any list in that plan.

You will be prompted to give the card a title. All cards must have a title. Once the card has been added to the list, you can manage its details by clicking on it to open its detail view.

If a user is assigned (or removed) as a member on a card, that user will receive a notification letting them know that they have been assigned to (or removed from) a card.
