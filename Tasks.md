# Tasks (HIGH-TIER)

The tasks module is a powerful way to manage the status of work being done in your Workspace. Tasks have a number of default fields relevant to nearly all projects, but Workspace owners can further customize their task module using the “Edit Fields” button. To create a new task, click the “New Task” button. SEE: [Edit Fields](Edit%20Fields.html), [Task Creation](Task%20Creation.html)

The task grid displays all tasks in your Workspace. By default, tasks are sorted by creation date, with older tasks appearing towards the top of the grid. The grid can be sorted by clicking on a column header (click again to reverse the sort, and a third time to revert to un-sorted). In addition, the grid can be filtered on an overall basis, or on a columnar basis. To filter the grid’s contents for a specific term, type the term into the field labeled “Filter”. To filter the grid’s contents on a columnar basis, click the down-arrow in the column header and select the value(s) to filter against. Filters are applied immediately.

Tasks can be edited directly in the grid. To change a task value, click on the field in the grid and type or select the new value. To open a task and view its full details, click on the pop-out icon to the left of the task’s name. Note that some task fields do not appear in the grid and can only be viewed or edited from within the task’s detail view. SEE: [Task Details](Task%20Details.html)
